in this little programm i've used the following concepts : 

==== Variables ===
int : integer , this type of variables accept numbers such as : -1 -2 10 2335 ..; it's use 4bytes of memorey;
float : this type of varibales accept numbers such as : 3.14 , 6.54 , 4.345 , 6-7 digits;  it's use 4bytes of memorey;
double : almost the same as float just it's accept up to 16 digits. it's use 8bytes of memorey

while , do while, for; 
You'll find some examples with good explantition in the source code;


==== if/else statements ===
You could check the source good for better understanding;
