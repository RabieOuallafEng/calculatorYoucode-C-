in this little programm i've used the following concepts : 

 ====⚡ Variables ⚡==== 

int : integer , this type of variables accept numbers such as : -1 -2 10 2335 ..; it's use 4 bytes of memorey;
float : this type of varibales accept numbers such as : 3.14 , 6.54 , 4.345 , 6-7 digits;  it's use 4bytes of memorey;
double : almost the same as float just it's accept up to 16 digits. it's use 8 bytes of memorey


📛 !! Note !! 📛

✋ ====  end ====🏻✋

💻 ==== loops ==== 💻 

while , do while, for; 
You'll find some examples with good explantition in the source code;

✋ ==== end ==== ✋🏻


⚡ ==== if/else statements === ⚡

You could check the source good for better understanding;

==== end ====✋🏻

👨‍💻 ==== logical operation ==== 👨‍💻

I've used only a few of them (like =! == ..);
for better understanding please check the sourc code and this article : https://byjus.com/gate/logical-operators-in-c/

==== end ====

 ====⚡ functions ⚡====
 
 We could say that function are a piece of code that could be repetead many times; 
 
 I've added a really code example of the functions in c and how it's works in the fifth mode of my calculator; 
 
 check it out !;
